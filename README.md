# TIC-TAC-TOE
The aim of this project is to create a Tic Tac Toe game using Java programming language with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Event-Window-Toolkit (EWT) library for event handling. The game will provide a user-friendly interface for players to enjoy the classic Tic Tac Toe game against either another player or an AI opponent.
